# Recording Enhancements - DOM Interaction Capture

## Summary

Enhanced the demonstration recording system to capture user DOM interactions including:
- âœ… **Click events** - Records all user clicks with element context
- âœ… **Text input** - Captures text entered in inputs, textareas, and contentEditable elements  
- âœ… **Form submissions** - Records form submission events

## Implementation Details

### 1. Content Script (`recordingListener.js`)

Created a new content script that:
- Listens for DOM events (click, input, submit) when recording is active
- Generates XPath for clicked/interacted elements
- Captures element attributes, text content, and context
- Debounces input events (500ms) to avoid recording every keystroke
- Sends interaction data to the background script via messaging

**Key Features:**
- Prevents re-injection with sentinel flag
- Includes XPath generation for element identification
- Captures comprehensive element metadata (tagName, attributes, textContent)
- Handles edge cases (contentEditable, various input types)

### 2. Updated Demonstration Recorder

Modified `recorder.ts` to:
- Inject `recordingListener.js` into all tabs when recording starts
- Re-inject script when pages reload during recording
- Handle messages from content script (`recording_interaction`)
- Stop recording listeners in all tabs when recording ends
- Apply minStepInterval to avoid duplicate events

**New Methods:**
- `injectRecordingListenerInTab()` - Injects script into a specific tab
- `injectRecordingListener()` - Injects into all open tabs
- `stopRecordingInTabs()` - Stops recording in all tabs
- `handleContentScriptInteraction()` - Processes events from content script

### 3. Enhanced Chrome Event Listeners

- Added `onMessage` listener to handle content script communication
- Auto-starts recording listener when content script loads
- Re-injects script on page navigation during recording

## Files Modified

1. **New File:** `chrome-extension/public/recordingListener.js`
   - Content script for capturing DOM interactions

2. **Modified:** `chrome-extension/src/background/memory/recorder.ts`
   - Added content script injection logic
   - Added message handling for recording interactions
   - Enhanced event listeners

3. **Modified:** `chrome-extension/src/background/memory/README.md`
   - Updated documentation to reflect new capabilities

4. **Modified:** `pages/side-panel/src/SidePanel.tsx`
   - Fixed port connection issue when opening Memory Panel

## How It Works

### Recording Flow

1. **User clicks "Start Recording"** in Memory Panel
   - Port connection established to background service
   - Recording status set to 'recording'
   - `recordingListener.js` injected into all open tabs
   - Event listeners attached in all tabs

2. **User performs actions** (clicks, types, submits forms)
   - Content script captures events
   - Events sent to background via `chrome.runtime.sendMessage`
   - Background recorder processes and stores events
   - Each event includes:
     - Action type (click, input, submit)
     - Element XPath and attributes
     - Description of the action
     - URL and page title
     - Timestamp

3. **User clicks "Stop Recording"**
   - Stop message sent to all tabs
   - Event listeners removed
   - Recording saved to storage with all captured steps

### Event Debouncing

**Input Events:** Debounced to 500ms to avoid recording every keystroke. Only the final text value is captured after the user stops typing.

**Click/Submit Events:** Recorded immediately with minStepInterval (500ms) enforcement to prevent duplicate captures.

## Testing Instructions

1. **Reload the extension:**
   ```
   chrome://extensions/
   â†’ Toggle extension off and on
   OR
   â†’ Click reload button
   ```

2. **Open Memory Panel:**
   - Click the Brain icon (ðŸ§ ) in the side panel header
   - Connection will be established automatically

3. **Start Recording:**
   - Enter a title (e.g., "Test Click and Input")
   - Click "Start Recording"
   - Recording listener is now active in all tabs

4. **Perform Test Actions:**
   - Navigate to a website (e.g., google.com)
   - Click various elements (buttons, links)
   - Type text in input fields
   - Submit a form (search form, login form, etc.)

5. **Stop Recording:**
   - Click "Stop & Save"
   - Recording saved with all captured steps

6. **Verify Recording:**
   - Check the recorded steps in the Recordings list
   - Click "Build Memory" to create procedural memory
   - Inspect the generated memory to see captured actions

## Example Recorded Steps

After recording a search on Google, you should see steps like:

```
1. go_to_url - Navigated to Google Search
2. click - Clicked input "Search"
3. input - Entered text into input (Search)
4. click - Clicked button "Google Search"
5. go_to_url - Navigated to search results
```

## Current Limitations

**Not Yet Captured:**
- Dropdown selections (complex selects with custom UI)
- Drag-and-drop interactions
- Hover-triggered actions
- Scroll events
- Right-click context menus

**Known Edge Cases:**
- Can't inject into `chrome://` or `chrome-extension://` pages
- Content script may not capture events on iframes without additional work
- Some SPAs with shadow DOM may require special handling

## Future Enhancements

1. **Dropdown Selection Support:**
   - Capture `change` events on `<select>` elements
   - Handle custom dropdown components

2. **Scroll Position Tracking:**
   - Record scroll events for pages requiring scroll-to-view

3. **Hover Event Capture:**
   - Record hover events that trigger UI changes

4. **Keyboard Shortcuts:**
   - Capture Ctrl+key, Cmd+key combinations

5. **Integration with Agent Actions:**
   - Have agent actions record themselves automatically
   - Enables recording of agent-performed tasks for self-improvement

## Troubleshooting

### Recording Not Capturing Clicks

**Cause:** Content script not injected or page loaded before recording started

**Solution:**
- Reload the page after starting recording
- Check browser console for injection errors
- Verify the page is not a chrome:// page

### Input Text Not Recorded

**Cause:** User navigated away or stopped recording too quickly

**Solution:**
- Wait 500ms after typing before moving to next action
- Input events are debounced to avoid capturing every keystroke

### "Connection to background service not established"

**Cause:** Port connection not initialized when opening Memory Panel

**Solution:** 
- This was fixed in the latest update
- Port connection now established automatically when Memory Panel opens
- If still occurring, try reloading the extension

## Security Considerations

- Content script only active during recording
- No data sent to external servers
- All recordings stored locally in Chrome storage
- Script avoids capturing sensitive data (passwords, credit cards) through normal browser security
- Recordings should be reviewed before sharing to ensure no sensitive info captured

## Performance Impact

**Minimal Impact:**
- Content script only injected during active recording
- Event listeners removed immediately when recording stops
- Debouncing prevents excessive message passing
- No continuous background polling

**Memory Usage:**
- Each recorded step is ~1-2KB
- Typical recording (50 steps) uses ~100KB
- Storage quota: Chrome local storage (unlimited with 'unlimitedStorage' permission)

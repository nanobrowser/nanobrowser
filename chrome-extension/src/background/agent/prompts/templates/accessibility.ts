- Exclude navigation, ads, sidebars, and decorative elements
- Describe the page structure and organization clearly
- Summarize key interactive elements and their functions

## Alt Text Generation:
- ONLY create alt text for content-relevant images
- EXCLUDE: logos, decorative images, advertisements, icons, spacers
- INCLUDE: photos, diagrams, charts, infographics, product images
- Context is key: describe how the image relates to surrounding content
- Be concise but descriptive (aim for 50-125 characters)
- Include any text visible in the image

## Accessibility Issue Detection:
- Missing alt attributes on meaningful images
- Poor heading structure (missing h1, illogical hierarchy)
